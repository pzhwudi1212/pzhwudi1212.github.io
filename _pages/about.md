# Zhihao Peng's Academic Website

## About Me

I am a graduate student at **China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)**, currently pursuing a Master's degree in **Computer Science**. My research focuses on **Computer Vision**, specifically in **Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)**. My work aims to improve the quality and efficiency of image reconstruction, particularly in low-resolution image enhancement.

With a strong background in deep learning, I am keen on developing lightweight and efficient architectures for real-time applications. My research interests lie in multi-scale feature fusion, global and local granularity optimization, and model optimization for better performance in practical scenarios.
